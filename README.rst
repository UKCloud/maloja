Maloja
::::::

A toolkit for use with a VMware cloud. Runs from the command line in Python 3.4 or above.

Stay in charge of your cloud
============================

* Maloja surveys your VMware virtual infrastructure and saves to a tidy
  collection of YAML files.
* With only a text editor you can build up a design for new cloud assets, pasting
  in the YAML descriptions of what you need.
* The Maloja *plan* command will tell you how your design looks and where there
  are mistakes.
* The Maloja *build* command will make the design for you.
* The Maloja *inspect* command will check what's built against the original design
  and warn you of any gaps.
* You can write *plugins* of your own to work with the Maloja framework.
